Things to measure

IBU (International Bittering Units)
SRM (Colour)
pH (acidity) 
Ca (Calcium)
Mg (Magnesium) - Acts as yeast nutrient 
HC03 (Bicarbonate) 
Cl (Chloride) - Flavour and mouthfeel of beer
Na (Sodium) - Not needed, happens in background or when adding table salt for adjusting water chemistry
S03 (Sulphate)
DO (Dissolved oxygen) 

Ways to measure
Hopefully: optical for the majority of the items. It is a big maybe. 

Day of brewing, optical is not going to be a good method. This is likely due to it likely being a time-consuming measurement. 
Current homebrewing technology uses a glassbulb reference, which needs to be kept in solution between uses. These tend to malfunction on a short-ish time scale. I would like to look into building a solid-state pH and DO sensor for day of brewing.
