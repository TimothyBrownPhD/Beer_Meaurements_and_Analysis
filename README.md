# Beer_Meaurements_and_Analysis
As a beer brewer, a physicist, with an interest in instrumentation, and a data nerd, this is a project that has been in the back of my mind for a while.

The plan is to measure things like IBU, pH, salts, colour, etc throughout the brewing process, then use data analysis to check for trends. The obvious to check for is measured IBU versus calculated IBU. Iâ€™m also curious about how water and mash chemistry changes throughout the brewing process, from before mashing the grains, mash, boiling and hop additions, fermentation, and dry hopping, just to list some of the major points.
